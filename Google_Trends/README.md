# Google Trends and Data Visualisation

Code: 

## Goal

Google Trends gives an estimate of search volume. I look to explore if there are patterns in Google's search volume on these datasets with these different datasets:

* How search volume for "Bitcoin" relates to the price of "Bitcoin"
* How search volume for a hot stock like Tesla relates to that stock price
* How seaches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary with the actual unemployment rate in the United States?

Data Sources:

Unemployment Rate from FRED
Google Trends
Yahoo Finance for Tesla Stock Price
Yahoo Finance for Bitcoin Stock Price
