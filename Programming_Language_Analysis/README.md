# Programming Language Analysis

Code: https://github.com/MunMunL/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Programming_Language_Analysis/Programming_Languages_(start).ipynb

## Goal
Analyse the tags from StackOverflow to analyse the popularity of different programming languages over time.

## Description
Data is extracted from [Stack Exchange](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/675441/popular-programming-languages-per-over-time-eversql-com) as at November 2023.

The project focused on analysing the number of tags on each post on Stack Overflow. The dataset included the programming language tag, date and the number of posts on that language on that date. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, manipulating data to performing exploratory data analysis (rolling average to smooth out time series data).


## Technology used

Technology: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data manipulation, data visualisation with Matplotlib (time series data)
