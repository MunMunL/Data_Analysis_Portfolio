# LEGO Analysis

Code: https://github.com/MunMunL/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/LEGO_Analysis/Lego_Analysis.ipynb

## Goal

This LEGO analysis dives deep into a dataset all about LEGO. From the dataset I look to understand about the history of the LEGO company, their product offering, and which LEGO set ultimately rules them all.


## Description

Data source: [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) has compiled data on all the LEGO pieces in existence. Data is from late 2020.

The project focused on analysing the dataset of all the LEGO pieces in existence.  The dataset included the name of LEGO sets, themes of LEGO sets, release year, number of parts in set  and other relevant information.  The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exporatory data analysis to answer these questions:

* What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?
* How did the LEGO company start out? In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?
* Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it one of LEGO's own themes like Ninjago or a theme they licensed liked Harry Potter or Marvel Superheroes?
* When did the LEGO company really expand its product offering? Can we spot a change in the company strategy based on how many themes and sets did it released year-on-year?
* Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?
