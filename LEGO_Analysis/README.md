# LEGO Analysis

Code: 

## Goal

This LEGO analysis dives deep into a dataset all about LEGO. From the dataset I look to understand about the history of the LEGO company, their product offering, and which LEGO set ultimately rules them all:

* What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?
* How did the LEGO company start out? In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?
* Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it one of LEGO's own themes like Ninjago or a theme they licensed liked Harry Potter or Marvel Superheroes?
* When did the LEGO company really expand its product offering? Can we spot a change in the company strategy based on how many themes and sets did it released year-on-year?
* Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?

[Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) has compiled data on all the LEGO pieces in existence. Data is from late 2020.

## Results

* How did the LEGO company start out? In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?

  LEGO started in 1949 and started selling only 5 different sets ranging from 12 pieces to 178 pieces.

* What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?

  The most enormous LEGO set is 'The Ultimate Battle for Chima' released in 2015 with 9,987 pieces.

* When did the LEGO company really expand its product offering? Can we spot a change in the company strategy based on how many themes and sets did it released year-on-year?

  First 45 years or so, LEGO had some steady growth in its product offering, but it was really in the mid-1990s that the number of sets produced by the company increased dramatically! We also see a brief decline in the early 2000s and a strong recovery around 2005 in the chart.

* Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?

  From the chart, there's an upward trend in the size and complexity of the LEGO sets based on the average number of parts. In the 2010s the average set contained around 200 individual pieces, which is roughly double what average LEGO set used to contain in the 1960s.

* Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it one of LEGO's own themes like Ninjago or a theme they licensed liked Harry Potter or Marvel Superheroes?

  Star Wars theme is has the largest number sets with just under 800 different sets.
