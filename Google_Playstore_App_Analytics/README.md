Code: https://github.com/MunMunL/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/Google_Playstore_App_Analytics

## Goal

Comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing thousands of apps in the Google Play store

## Description

Data Source:
App and review data was scraped from the Google Play Store by Lavanya Gupta in 2018. Original files listed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps)

The project focused on analysing the dataset of all Google Play store apps. The dataset included the app rating, number of reviews, number of installs, price of app, category and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exporatory data analysis to gain insights into:

* How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are

* Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity

* How many downloads you would give up by making your app paid vs. free

* How much you can reasonably charge for a paid app

* Which paid apps have had the highest revenue

* How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue
